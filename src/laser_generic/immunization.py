"""
Immunization components for LASER models.

These components introduce immunity into the agent population during a simulation.

Notes
-----
- Deployment is currently global (all patches). Future extensions may include:
  * targeting by patch or lists of patches,
  * patch-varying coverage,
  * time-varying routine immunization (RI) coverage.
- The routine immunization window centers on the target age with width â‰ˆ period,
  i.e., [age - period/2, age + period/2).
