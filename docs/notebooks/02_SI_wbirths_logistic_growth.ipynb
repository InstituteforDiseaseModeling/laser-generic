    "This notebook tests the implementation and behavior of the model as follows:\n",
    "### Construct the model\n",
    "In the first few cells, we do all the necessary imports.  Then we construct a single-patch LASER model with three components: `Susceptibility`, `Transmission`, and `Births_ConstantPop`.  Finally, we initialize with a single infection and run.  The `Susceptibility` and `Transmission` components are described in the the model with no births.  `Births_ConstantPop` strictly enforces constant population - rather than having separate, random birth and death process, births are implemented by randomly choosing an existing agent and re-initializing them as a newborn.  Births are drawn from a Poisson distribution with rate determined by parameter `cbr` (in units of births per 1000 population per year). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sanity check\n",
    "The first test ensures certain basic constraints are being obeyed by the model.  We confirm that at each timestep, $S_t=N_t-I_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific test\n",
    "Finally, we come to the scientific test.  First, we run a basic test on a single model, and show the result matches expectation with known inputs.  Then, as before, we select a few values of $\\beta$ and $\\mu$, run the model, fit the outputs to the logistic equation, and compare the fitted values of the parameters to the known value.  The equation above makes it clear that attempting to fit $\\beta, \\mu$ and N all together will be degenerate - the logistic equation has two parameters, not three; in this case those two are the products $N x$ and $\\beta x$.  Thus, we fix the total population size $N$ in the fit to focus on the more interesting $\\beta$ and $\\mu$ parameters.  And as before, because we are approximating continuously compounding growth, in the logistic equation, with a discrete time-step approximation, we expect the fitted values of $\\beta$ to be biased slightly downward - that is, the modeled trajectory is slightly slower than the continuous-time counterpart.  This error grows as $\\beta$ gets larger; the test fails if any of the fitted $\\beta$ values are more than 5% away from the known values.  Furthermore, if the outbreak is seeded by only one infection, it is possible that that one infection dies prior to infecting anyone else; we therefore seed with a few infections rather than one.\n",
