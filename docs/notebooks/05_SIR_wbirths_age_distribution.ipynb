    "The equation above is often also described as the average age at infection.  However, it is key to remember that the measured age at infection will be censored by non-disease deaths occurring at a rate μ.  You can work through the impact of this, but in the simple case of constant mortality, it turns out to exactly balance out the *-1* in the above equation, and so our *observed* average age at infection will be *1/μR<sub>0</sub>*.  Since the hazard is constant at equilibrium, this implies an exponential distribution:\n",

    "In the first few cells, we do all the necessary imports.  Because we are now measuring an equilibrium property of this system, we will have to burn in, with repeated infection importations to ensure that we establish an endemic equilibrium.  We also need to model a large enough population to sustain the infection (see Critical Community Size notebook).  The primary determinant of the critical community size is the duration of infection, so keeping this relatively long (2 months) prevents us from needing huge agent populations.  So, we construct a single-patch LASER model with five components: `Births_ConstantPop`, `Susceptibility`, `Transmission`, `Infection`, and `Infect_Random_Agents`, a function that implements repeated importation for a fixed period of time. \n",

    "The scientific test will sample a set of (μ, γ, R<sub>0</sub>) pairs and confirm that both the age at infection and the fraction of susceptibles at a given age are well-described by exponential distributions and that the associated rate constant is as expected.   \n",
    "\n",
