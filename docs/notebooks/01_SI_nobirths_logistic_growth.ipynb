This model has two classes of individuals, the infective and the susceptible, and 1 parameter, β, describing the per-timestep, per-infective person rate at which susceptibles transition to infectives.\n",

    "In the first few cells, we do all the necessary imports.  Then we construct a single-patch LASER model with two components: Susceptibility and Transmission.  Finally, we initialize with a single infection and run.  The Susceptibility component endows both agents and patches in the model with a `susceptibility` quantity.  For the agents, this represents their state (infective = 0, susceptible = 1), and for the patch, it represents the total population of susceptible agents.  The differential equation above is converted into a stochastic finite difference equation\n",

    "Finally, we come to the scientific test.  We select a few values of β, run the model, fit the outputs to the logistic equation, and compare the fitted value of β to the known value.  Because we are approximating continuously compounding growth, in the logistic equation, with a discrete time-step approximation, we expect the fitted values of β to be biased slightly downward - that is, the modeled trajectory is slightly slower than the continuous-time counterpart.  This error grows as β gets larger; the test fails if any of the fitted β values are more than 5% away from the known values.\n",

    "Introducing stochasticity into a model can result in more than just noise around a mean trajectory, and this simple model is a great example. In the early stages of the outbreak, the infection count is low, and the timing of those first few infections dictates when the logistic growth really takes off.  This appears as a random time-shift in the entire outbreak trajectory.    To illustrate this phenomenon, the below plot shows the model output, the expected logistic growth curve, and the expected logistic growth curve fit to the model with one free parameter -  an offset *t<sub>0</sub>*.  The resulting plot should show good concordance between the model output and the expected logistic equation with the known model inputs β and population.\n",
