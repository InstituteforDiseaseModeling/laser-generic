    "We move next to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, the first of these canonical test models that actually provides a decent, coarse, representation of many vaccine-preventable diseases that we are interested in.  This test will explore the size of acute outbreaks; in this situation, the role of demography is pretty small and serves only to complicate the analysis, so we will work without demography.  The model contains three agent states and two transitions: susceptible -> infected -> recovered, with the recovered state assumed to be lifelong.\n",

    "In the first few cells, we do all the necessary imports.  Then we construct a single-patch LASER model with three components: `Susceptibility`, `Transmission`, and `Infection`.  The `Susceptibility` component adds an agent property `susceptibility`, and the `Infection` component will require a new agent property `itimer`.  The `S` state is defined by `susceptibility==1`, the `I` state by `itimer>0`, and the `R` state by `itimer<=0 and susceptibility==0`.  Finally, we initialize with a handful of infections and run.  The `Susceptibility` and `Transmission` components are previously described. \n",

As this is a stochastic model, the main concern is that when *R<sub>0</sub>S(0)* is close to one, the outbreak may fail to take off or truncate at a slightly smaller final size.  \n",
