# Tutorials

The following code examples demonstrate how to build and run models using LASER.

In the Notebooks section, interactive Jupyter notebooks will allow you to explore dynamics of pre-built LASER models, beginning with simple SI models with no demographics and adding in more complexity in each subsequent notebook.


<!--Need to include an introduction explaining what's in here, overview of tasks, notebooks, etc. Note that code blocks should go on topic pages (vs sticking them all here), this is just for workflows, jupyter notebooks, end-to-end examples, etc. -->
